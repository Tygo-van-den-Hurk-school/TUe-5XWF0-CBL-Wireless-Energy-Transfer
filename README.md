# TUe-5XWF0-CBL-Wireless-Energy-Transfer
In this CBL, teams of 7-10 students will embark on a comprehensive journey encompassing the design, construction, and testing of a wireless energy transfer system. Within this project, students will engage in the designing power electronic converters, transformers and inductors, energy flow control mechanisms, and tackle real-world challenges.

## Source Code
The repository is comprised of two modules:
- [The DC-DC converter module](./src/dc-to-dc-module/README.md)
- [The DC-AC converter module](./src/dc-to-ac-module/README.md)

of which you can read more in their respective components. There's also the [testing module](./src/test/README.md), where you can create test projects local to your machine. Here you can quickly test a concept without clogging the repository.
