# Team name To be detirmed 
We are group 1, but we go by [DETERMINE NAME](#). If you need to talk to us, you can talk to our project leader Gabriel. Our idea of the load is to charge a drone.  We have locker 6.

## Goal
In this CBL, teams of 7-10 students will embark on a comprehensive journey encompassing the design, construction, and testing of a wireless energy transfer system. Within this project, students will engage in the designing power electronic converters, transformers and inductors, energy flow control mechanisms, and tackle real-world challenges.

## Sub-Teams
The CBL is recommended to do in 4 sub-teams: power electronics, micro-controller, PCB, and magnetics.

### Power Electronics
Power electronic was recommended to have between 2 and 4 members. The following members decided to join this sub-team: **Bart**, Bjorn, Luis. Where the bold written name has the card. They will be going to the MOSFET workshop.

### Micro-controller
Micro-controller was recommended to have between 2 and 3 members. The following members decided to join this sub-team: **Gabriel**, Tygo. Where the bold written name has the card. They will be going to the micro controller workshop.

### PCB
PCB was recommended to have between 2 and 3 members. The following members decided to join this sub-team: **Octavian**, and luis. Where the bold written name has the card. They will be going to the PCB workshop.

### Magnetics
Magnetics was recommended to have between 2 and 3 members. The following members decided to join this sub-team:  **Eeshsa**, Athanas, and Qian yu. Where the bold written name has the card. They will be going to the generator workshop.

## Action Points
The following people got the following action points:
- **tygo**: make a OneDrive, and a GitHub
- **Qian Yu**: make a logo for the group. This is not mandatory.
- **Luis**, **alehandro**: get things from Flux
